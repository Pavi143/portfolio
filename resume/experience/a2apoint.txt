At A2APoint, I single-handedly built the entire technological infrastructure, leading a team to deliver robust web and mobile applications. Developed a Next.js web app and a React Native mobile app from a single codebase (universal development, have written a blog as well), along with CMS, dashboards, multi-factor authentication, and various integrated features. Utilized React.js, Next.js, React Native, Node.js, Keycloak, PostgreSQL, Docker, and CI/CD pipelines. The project is estimated to have atleast 5000 active users per month.
