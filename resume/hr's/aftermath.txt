Hi [Recipient's Name],

I am extremely pleased to hear your quick response and your interest in referring me for a job. Unfortunately, my friends at Nutanix informed me that entry-level positions are typically reserved for on-campus placements and from internships. As a student from a tier 3 college, there are no openings available for me on the job portal.

I even applied for the MTS-II position, but the ATS quickly rejected my resume due to a lack of experience. Despite having all the necessary skills and qualifications for an entry-level job, I am struggling to secure even one interview opportunity.

Most of my applications have gone unanswered, and it seems many people have turned a blind eye and deaf ear to my situation. I have worked tirelessly for two years, and it is disheartening that just because I am from a tier 3 college, I cannot get even one interview chance.

All I ask is for one interview opportunity to prove myself. I would be more than willing to start with an internship if thatâ€™s what it takes.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,
