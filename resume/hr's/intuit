Hi Shruti,

Given your extensive experience in talent acquisition and recruitment, I believe you would be an excellent person to connect with regarding opportunities at Rubrik. I am actively seeking a fresher or internship position and am very enthusiastic about contributing to your esteemed company. With a strong foundation in computer science and practical development experience, I am eager to leverage my skills in a dynamic environment like Rubrik.

In my recent work at A2APoint (https://a2apoint.com), I single-handedly built the entire technological infrastructure, leading a team to deliver robust web and mobile applications. Developed a Next.js web app and a React Native mobile app from a single codebase (universal development, have written a blog as well), along with CMS, dashboards, multi-factor authentication, and various integrated features. Utilized React.js, Next.js, React Native, Node.js, Keycloak, PostgreSQL, Docker, and CI/CD pipelines. The project is estimated to have atleast 5000 active users per month.

I am confident that my background and skills align well with entry-level positions or internships, and I would appreciate the chance to discuss how I can contribute to your team. An opportunity to interview would be greatly valued and would help me better understand how I can fit into your organization.

Thank you for considering this request. I look forward to your positive response.
