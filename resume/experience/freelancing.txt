I began my freelancing career by developing various full-stack applications for alumni, starting with smaller projects and gradually taking on more complex challenges. One of my notable freelancing achievements is the development of https://designeration.agency, a comprehensive full-stack application featuring a custom CMS. This project highlights my ability to deliver robust, scalable solutions tailored to client needs, showcasing my proficiency in both front-end and back-end technologies.
