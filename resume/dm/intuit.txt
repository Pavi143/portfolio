Hi Krithika,

I hope you’re well. Over the past 2 years, I’ve honed my skills in full-stack development and recently completed a significant project with A2APoint (https://a2apoint.com). I single-handedly built the technological infrastructure for this project, including a Next.js web app and a React Native mobile app from a single codebase, along with CMS, dashboards, multi-factor authentication, and integrated features. Technologies used include React.js, Next.js, React Native, Node.js, Keycloak, PostgreSQL, Docker, and CI/CD pipelines. The project now expects to have around 5,000 active users per month.
 
My friends at Intuit mentioned that fresher roles are typically available through college placements and internships. I’m very interested in the an entry level role and am confident I can excel in the interview. If this role isn’t available, I would also be eager to explore internship opportunities.
 
I would greatly appreciate your referral and the opportunity to discuss how my background and skills align with Intuit's needs.
 
Thank you for considering my request. I look forward to your response.
 
Best regards,
Joel
