I have actively contributed to several open source projects, including fixing documentation inaccuracies for expo.dev, directus.io, and other smaller projects. Notably, I improved the source code of directus.io (26.5k stars), with my PR #22888 being merged. I also developed and maintain the Catppuccin Flutter library, which ports the Catppuccin color scheme to Flutter and is available on pub.dev. As a full-time maintainer and member of the Catppuccin organization, I continue to drive improvements and support the project.
